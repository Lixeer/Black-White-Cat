>A chat application Based on the concept of distributed servers


## 1 introduction

- open-source
- absolutely secure
- All servers will be set up by user, without any official servers

## 2 idea
>In this chat application, the server won't know who you are. You can decide what your name is, and you can have the same name as someone else. Every chat you join is on a different server, as long as your key (group chat invitation link), you can join the group chat. You can also set up your own server to ensure absolute security if needed.
