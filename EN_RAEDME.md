>Black-White-Cat -- An Open-Source Chat Application


[简体中文](https://github.com/Lixeer/Black-White-Cat)


## 1 Introduction
>BWC is a decentralized chat application built on a distributed server architecture. Designed to provide a truly secure and free communication platform, BWC empowers users to self-host their own servers, eliminating the need for any centralized authority.

- Open-Source：Believing transparency is the cornerstone of trust, BWC's source code is entirely open to public scrutiny. Anyone can review the codebase and contribute their ideas.
- Self-Hosted：We encourages users to set up their own servers, granting complete control over data security and privacy.

## 2 Concepts
### Distributed Server Architecture
>BWC employs an innovative distributed architecture where each chat room is essentially a standalone server. This design enhances system stability, security, and safeguards user privacy.

- Anonymity：Servers in BWC are unaware of users' real identities. Users can adopt any preferred alias without fear of duplication.


- Encryption Keys：Each chat room has a unique key (the group invitation link) that grants access.


- Self-Hosting：Users can establish their own servers to meet individual or group needs, ensuring absolute communication security and independence from third-party interference.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE!!!：
###### This BWC repository a server-side software, not a client.
